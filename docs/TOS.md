Effective Date: 12/10/2025
Last Updated: 12/2/2025
Welcome to STUDYHIVE, a web-based educational and e-commerce platform designed and developed as part of an academic project at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website, services, and content. By accessing or using our website, you agree to be bound by these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with any of these Terms, you must not use the website.

## 1. Purpose of the Platform

STUDYHIVE is a prototype learning and resource-sharing website designed for academic demonstration purposes. The platform allows users to upload, organize, and access study materials enhanced through AI-based summarization and collaboration tools. While the website demonstrates core e-commerce and educational features, it is not a commercial business and does not facilitate real financial transactions, sales, or third-party partnerships. All features and content are for educational use only and serve as an example of what a functioning product could look like in a real-world setting.

## 2. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using STUDYHIVE, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old or have obtained consent from a parent or guardian if you are under 18. You agree to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws when using the platform. These Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and the creators of this website (referred to as “we,” “our,” or “the Developers”). You also acknowledge that this platform is a class project and not a fully operational business entity.

## 3. User Accounts

To access certain features of the website, users may be required to create an account by providing a valid email address and password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login information and for all activity under your account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration. The Developers reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that are found to contain false information or are used in violation of these Terms.

## 4. Educational and Demonstrative Nature

This website and its contents are intended solely for academic and instructional purposes. Any simulated e-commerce components, such as “subscription tiers” or “premium access,” are non-functional demonstrations and do not involve actual payments or exchanges of money. All user data entered during testing or demonstrations is used only for presentation and grading purposes in an academic setting. The platform does not store, process, or share user data for commercial gain.

## 5. Intellectual Property Rights

All text, code, graphics, user interface design, and documentation created for STUDYHIVE are the intellectual property of the project’s creators: Andrew Gardner, Jovan Fernandez, Umar Farooq, and Elliot Cecere, and are used exclusively for educational purposes. You may not copy, reproduce, modify, or distribute any materials without written consent from the developers or NJIT. Any third-party logos, icons, or external resources used for educational demonstration remain the property of their respective owners.

## 6. User Content

Users may upload content such as class notes, text files, or study materials to demonstrate the platform’s functionality. By uploading content, you grant the Developers a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, and test your content solely for demonstration purposes. You must ensure that any uploaded content does not infringe upon copyright, privacy, or intellectual property rights of others. Content that is found to violate these rules may be removed without notice.

## 7. Prohibited Conduct

Users agree not to:

- Upload, post, or share content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, or discriminatory.

- Use the platform for real commercial activity, advertising, or solicitation.

- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the website or interfere with its operations.
- Upload malicious software or engage in actions that could damage, disable, or impair the platform.

- Impersonate another user, entity, or organization.
  Violation of these terms may result in the termination of your account or access privileges.

## 8. Privacy and Data Usage

The website may collect limited user information such as names, emails, and uploaded content for demonstration purposes only. This information will not be shared with third parties, sold, or used for marketing. All data handling complies with institutional privacy guidelines under NJIT’s academic policies. No sensitive or financial data should be entered into the platform. Users are responsible for ensuring that the information they upload does not include personal identifiers or confidential information.

## 9. Third-Party Links and Resources

The website may include references or links to third-party educational resources, such as Notion, Chegg, or Quizlet. These links are included for educational illustration and do not imply partnership, endorsement, or integration. The Developers are not responsible for the content, policies, or practices of these external sites.

## 10. Disclaimer of Warranties

This platform is provided “as is” and “as available” for educational purposes only. The Developers make no warranties, express or implied, regarding the operation, availability, or accuracy of the website or its content. We disclaim all warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Because this is a student-created project, users should not rely on it for any real-world commercial, legal, or academic decisions.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances shall the Developers, NJIT, or any associated faculty members be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use this website. This includes but is not limited to loss of data, service interruption, or any other damages, even if the Developers were advised of the possibility of such damages.

## 12. Suspension and Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate user access at any time for any reason, including violation of these Terms or academic misuse. Suspension or deletion of user data may occur without prior notice as this project is non-commercial and temporary in nature. Users who are part of the academic course can request the deletion of test data by contacting the development team directly.

## 13. Modifications to the Service

Because this website is a continuously evolving academic project, features, layouts, and content may change frequently. The Developers reserve the right to modify or discontinue any part of the platform without prior notice. Users are encouraged to review these Terms periodically for updates. Continued use of the website following changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 14. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms shall be resolved through NJIT’s academic policies and not through civil court proceedings.

## 16. Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the user and the Developers regarding the use of STUDYHIVE. They supersede any prior agreements, discussions, or understandings, whether written or oral. If any part of these Terms is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
